## Problem Statement


According to The Federation of Kenya Employers, Kenya National Bureau of Statistics, and World Economic Forum research:
67% youth unemployment affects 13+ million young people who lack career path clarity
Only 3.5% complete university with 55% digital skills - leaving youth confused about tech alternatives
Kenya's ICT sector grows 10.8% annually but youth don't know which skills to prioritize
By 2030, 50-55% of jobs need digital skills yet youth waste months without guidance
This contributes to $449.7 billion in global unrealized output from tech worker shortages
